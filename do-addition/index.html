<!-- 
    LOADING THE WASM CODE

    Must use an async function as all Wasm code must be asynchronously loaded

    The WebAssembly module in JavaScript exposes APIs for working with Wasm files and types,
    but the easiest to use is instantiateStreaming which letâ€™s us fetch our Wasm code
    and turn it into a module which we can interact with from JavaScript

    This function (instantiateStreaming) returns a result object which contains an instance object and a module object

    The instance object contains references to all the exported Wasm functions

    The add function can be found as a property on the exports property of the instance object
    Therefore, we can treat instance.exports.add like a JavaScript function

    The Rust compiler knows how to turn Rust code into the Wasm format
    The JavaScript engine in the browser knows how to load Wasm code

    The one caveat is that the only Rust functions
    which are valid to expose to Wasm only deal with integers and floating point numbers
