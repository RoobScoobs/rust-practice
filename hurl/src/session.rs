    SESSIONS MODULE

    A common pattern that comes up when testing APIs on the command line
    is to make multiple requests that depend on one another

    The most common dependency comes from authentication where a user logs in
    and then wants to perform some actions

    A session is the common terminology for a set of activity between logging in and logging out
