<!--
    THE INTERACTION WITH WEBASSEMBLY
  
    First step is to call a helper function (passStringToWasm) that takes our input argument
    and turns it into the pointer and length that we can call our Wasm function with

    This function puts the JavaScript string we took as an argument
    into the linear memory space shared between JavasScript and Wasm

    Inside the try block, first call the greet function that's exposed from rust
    with the pointer and length returned from the helper function
    and declare a local variable to hold the pointer to the String that is returned
    
    This pointer points to a chunk of memory inside the Wasm linear memory region

    Able to get a handle to the memory region shared with Wasm
    via the buffer property on the memory property that is exposed on our Wasm instance

    The WebAssembly.Memory object can do two things,
    one is grow the memory region via a grow method,
    the other is give a handle to the underlying memory via the buffer property

    FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT FOR WORKING WITH THE SHARED MEMORY REGION BETWEEN JS AND WASM

    JavaScript has a variety of typed arrays for exposing an array-like view of an underlying buffer of binary data

    The Wasm memory region is 32-bits, so we can construct an array which contains unsigned 32-bit integers
    by passing the Wasm buffer into the Uint32Array constructor

    Are able to create a typed array with the shared buffer and then read or write to this typed array
    Wasm can also read and write this buffer

    HOW TO GET THE RUST POINTER AND LENGTH

    The pointer that is returned from the Wasm function (greet) is an offset from the beginning of the memory region, due to the return type
    
    Add to the fact that the array view over the memory buffer has type Uint32
    have to do a little bit of arithmetic to get the array index for the pointer to the underlying bytes ergo
        - mem[retptr / 4]
    and the index of the length of the returned String
        - mem[retptr / 4 + 1]

    This works because in Rust a String is just a Vec<u8>
    and a Vec<u8> is a struct with two fields,
    the first being roughly a pointer to a buffer of u8 values,
    and the second is a length

    EXTRACTING THE STRING FROM THE WASM MEMORY REGION

    Given a pointer to some bytes and a length, use another utility function (getStringFromWasm)
    to extract a string from the Wasm memory region into JavaScript

    Calling slice() to make a copy tells Rust to free the memory it is currently using for that string

    The __boxed_str_free will take a *mut String and do whatever is necessary to free it

    No matter what happens in this whole process, if something goes wrong or not,
    the finally block will execute and free the memory in the Wasm address space
    associated with the argument

    We used passStringToWasm to move the argument into the Wasm memory so we use __free to let it go

    THE passStringToWasm HELPER FUNCTION

    JavaScript provides an API for turning a string into a memory buffer via a TextEncoder object

    Want the string encoded as UTF-8 to conform to the invariants in our Rust code

    Then ask the Wasm instance to allocate memory of this particular size via a call to __malloc

    Create a Uint8Array with the Wasm memory buffer
    so that we can set the newly allocated memory to the bytes of our string

    THE getStringFromWasm HELPER FUNCTION

    This is mostly the reverse process of putting the string into the memory region
    
    Get a Uint8Array view of the Wasm memory
    and then use slice to copy the bytes into a new typed array specified by the starting and ending points

    Given this array of bytes we use a TextDecoder to turn it into a string,
    again assuming that the bytes represent a UTF-8 string
