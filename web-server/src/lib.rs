    BUILDING THE THREADPOOL STRUCT

    ThreadPool implementation will be independent of the kind of work the web server is doing;
    thus it can be in its own library crate

    VALIDATING THE NUMBER OF THREADS IN NEW

    Chose an unsigned type for the size parameter,
    because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense

    However, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, so add validation for zero

    Added some documentation for the ThreadPool with doc comments (///)

    Note that good documentation practices include adding a section
    that calls out the situations in which the function can panic

    scaffold and view documentation by running cargo doc --open (incredibly dope feature!)

    HOW TO STORE A THREAD?

    Looking at the thread::spawn signature the function returns a JoinHandle<T>,
    where T is the type that the closure returns

        pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
            where
                F: FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,
                T: Send + 'static
    
    In our case, the closures weâ€™re passing to the thread pool will handle the connection
    and not return anything, so T will be the unit type ()

    The field threads in our ThreadPool struct will hold a vector of thread::JoinHandle<()> instances

    Given that the type in the vector is thread::JoinHandle, must bring into scope std::thread
    
    Once a valid size is received, use the Vec::with_capacity fn
    to essentially perform the same task as Vec::new, however, with_capacity
    preallocates space in the vector, which is more efficient

    A WORKER STRUCT RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING CODE FROM THE THREADPOOL TO A THREAD

    The standard library provides thread::spawn as a way to create threads,
    and thread::spawn expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the thread is created

    However, in this example, want the ability to create the threads
    and have them wait for code that will be sent later

    To implement this behavior a data structure called Worker is introduced,
    which is a common term in pooling implementations 

    Instead of storing a vector of JoinHandle<()> instances in the thread pool,
    instances of the Worker struct will be stored

    Each Worker will store a single JoinHandle<()> instance

    A Worker will have a method that will take a closure of code to run
    and send it to the already running thread for execution

use std::thread;

pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
}

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>,
}

impl ThreadPool {
    /// Create a new ThreadPool
    /// 
    /// The size is the number of threads in the pool
    /// 
    /// # Panics
    /// 
    /// The `new` function will panic if the size is zero
     
    pub fn new(size: usize) -> ThreadPool {
        assert!(size > 0);

        let mut workers = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for id in 0..size {
            workers.push(Worker::new(id));
        }

        ThreadPool { workers }
    }
}

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(|| {});

        Worker {
            id,
            thread
        }
    }
}
